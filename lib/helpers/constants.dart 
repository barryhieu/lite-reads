const String chapter1 = '''Chapter 1: Shadows of Silence

The grandfather clock struck midnight, its echo trembling through the hollow corridors of Blackthorn Manor. Elena Blackthorn sat alone in the drawing room, the fire reduced to a faint amber glow. The shadows danced on the mahogany walls, whispering secrets only the silence could hear.

On the table before her lay an envelope — yellowed with age, sealed with the crest of the Blackthorn family: a raven clutching a rose. It had arrived that morning, postmarked from a decade ago. The handwriting on it was unmistakable.

Her father’s.

Elena’s breath hitched. Her father, Lord Alaric Blackthorn, had vanished ten years earlier under circumstances no one in the village dared speak about. No body was found. No trace left behind. Only rumors — of betrayal, madness, and something darker.

She ran her fingers over the seal. It cracked open with a soft snap, and inside was a letter written in careful, deliberate strokes.

"My dearest Elena,

If you're reading this, then I have failed to return. I write not to say goodbye, but to confess the truth buried beneath generations of lies. You must know everything — about the fire, your mother, and... the child."

Her pulse quickened. The child?

"There was another life, hidden from you. One I thought I could protect you from. But secrets grow like weeds in darkness, and soon they choke the truth. The night your mother died was no accident. I only pray you forgive me."

Elena gripped the letter tighter, her knuckles white. The room suddenly felt colder.

She rose, crossing the creaking floorboards to the tall window. Rain lashed against the glass, lightning slicing the sky into pieces. In the dim reflection, she saw herself — but for a fleeting second, she thought she saw someone behind her.

She turned. Nothing.

Her gaze landed on the attic door at the top of the stairs. It had always been locked. Off-limits since the day of the fire. Her father had called it "a place best left undisturbed."

But tonight, the lock was gone.

Elena lit a candle, its flame flickering as if anxious to follow. The stairs groaned beneath her weight as she ascended. Dust thickened with each step. The air grew mustier, heavier — as if it hadn’t been disturbed in years.

She pushed open the attic door. It creaked with a reluctant moan.

Inside, the air was stale. Moonlight filtered through a cracked skylight, casting a soft glow over forgotten furniture and broken memories. A crib sat under a moth-eaten sheet.

Her candle trembled.

With slow, deliberate hands, she pulled back the sheet.

Beneath it wasn’t a child’s crib — not anymore. It was an ornate chest, carved with the same raven crest as the envelope.

Inside, she found faded photographs, brittle letters, and a birth certificate.

Name: Julian Blackthorn
Date of Birth: March 3, 2003
Mother: Liora Blackthorn
Father: Alaric Blackthorn

Elena’s heart thundered.

She had no siblings.

At least… that’s what she’d always believed.

The next document was a coroner’s report. Cause of death: undetermined trauma. Subject: Liora Blackthorn.

But scrawled at the bottom was a handwritten note:
"Body removed before autopsy. Report falsified."

A cold shiver slid down Elena’s spine.

Then she saw a photograph. Her mother, younger, smiling… with a boy beside her.

The boy had her father's eyes.

Suddenly, the candle flickered and extinguished.

The room fell into pitch-black silence.

Then — a whisper.

“Elena…”

She spun around, heart pounding in her ears.

“Elena…”

This time, closer. The voice was male. Familiar.

She backed against the wall, breath caught in her throat.

“Who’s there?” she demanded, her voice shaking.

No reply.

Only the sound of slow footsteps descending the attic stairs — but she wasn’t moving.

She burst from the attic, nearly tumbling down the stairs. As she reached the landing, the power returned. The hallway light blinked on.

Silence.

Was it her mind unraveling?

Or had something in the manor awoken with the truth?

Back in the drawing room, she sat trembling, the letter clutched in her hands. Her entire life had been a carefully constructed lie. A mother murdered. A brother hidden. A father vanished.

And someone — or something — still watching.

She stared at the hearth, where embers now glowed like the eyes of ghosts.

Then she noticed something in the flames.

A shape. A figure.

No — a symbol.

A raven, wings spread wide, burned into the ashes.''';
